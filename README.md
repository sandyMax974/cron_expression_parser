# Technical Task - Cron Expression Parser (Ruby)

**Status**: Incomplete

Command line script which parses a cron string and expands each field to show the times at which it will run. 

You should only consider the standard cron format with five time fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week) plus a command, and you do not need to handle the special time strings such as "@yearly". The input will be on a single line.
The cron string will be passed to your application as a single argument.

The output should be formatted as a table with the field name taking the first 14 columns and
the times as a space-separated list following it. For example, the following input argument:
```
*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find
```
Should yield the following output:
  
```
minute        0 15 30 45
hour          0
day of month  1 15
month         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
dayofweek     1 2 3 4 5
command       /usr/bin/find
```

You should spend no more than three hours on this exercise. If you do not have time to handle all possible cron strings then an app which handles a subset of them correctly is better than one which does not run or produces incorrect results. You â€‹will be asked to extend the solution with additional features while onsite.

## How to run

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sandyMax974/cron_expression_parser.git
$ cd cron_expression_parser
$ bundle install
$ cron_expression_parser "*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find"
```
